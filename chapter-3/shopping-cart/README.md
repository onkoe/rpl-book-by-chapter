# Shopping Cart

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple shopping cart program that allows a user to add and remove items from a shopping cart, display the cart contents, and calculate the total cost of the items in the cart.

## Requirements
The program should:
- Allow the user to add items to the cart
- Allow the user to remove items from the cart
- Display the current contents of the cart
- Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use a vector to store the items in the cart
- Use `std::io` module to handle user input/output
- Use a `loop` to allow the user to add or remove items until they are finished
- Use conditional statements to handle different user inputs
- Use `structs` and `enums` to represent items and their properties
- Use functions to encapsulate common operations such as adding and removing items from the cart, displaying the cart contents, and calculating the total cost of the items in the cart.

## Deliverables
- A command-line program that allows the user to add and remove items from a shopping cart, display the cart contents, and calculate the total cost of the items in the cart.

## Grading Criteria
The program should:
-  Allow the user to add and remove items from the cart
-  Display the current contents of the cart
-  Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart
-  Be well-documented and easy to follow

## Conclusion
In this project, you have learned how to use common programming concepts such as vectors, user input/output, loops, conditional statements, and functions to implement a simple shopping cart program. This project can be extended to add more complex features such as an inventory system, discounts, and tax calculation.
